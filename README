This is a mostly empty rails project I'm creating for iDeeli as a
programming exercise during the interview process.

Write a model (ActiveRecord-based) for storing global configuration
settings. It will be used for storing single values, for example an
email address to send error emails to, or a flag enable/disable a
particular feature. The interface must be simple and convenient, - it
should be possible to read and write specific configuration items. It
must be possible to store values of these 4 types: string, integer,
float and boolean. The model should come with a unit test and a
migration.

Bonus: add caching within the model so that values are cached in
regular Rails cache to minimize db load.
